A Chrome App Wattpad Client

## Installation
1. Download the whole branch as a ZIP file.
2. Then, copy the contents of the ZIP file into a folder of its own, maybe on the Desktop, maybe in your Documents. Somewhere you won't move any more.
3. Go to chrome://extensions in the URL bar (You have to have Chrome!), and check "Developer Mode".
4. Click on "Load Unpacked Extension", and open the folder you created.
5. Done.
