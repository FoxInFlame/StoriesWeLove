# StoriesWeLove
A Chrome App Wattpad Client

## Installation
Download the whole branch as a ZIP file.
Then, copy the contents of the ZIP file into a folder of its own, maybe on the Desktop, maybe in your Documents. Somewhere you won't move any more.
Go to chrome://extensions in the URL bar (You have to have Chrome!), and check "Developer Mode".
Click on "Load Unpacked Extension", and open the folder you created.

Done.
